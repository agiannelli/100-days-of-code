# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday, December 22, 2020

Today I made the decision to join #100DaysOfCode.  Being an almost strictly back-end developer, I would like to learn front-end technologies. My plan is to work through curriculum at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and do the projects.  My ultimate goal is to start building my personal website, giannelli.tech.
